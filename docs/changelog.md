## Migration Notes

### Upgrading to 9.0.0

Configuration files have been reorganized:

```bash
# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Update your .env if using custom configs
# Old: retriever_weights in multiple places
# New: Unified in config/ingestion.yaml
```

### Upgrading to 2.0.0

Multi-user authentication requires database migration:

```bash
# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Default credentials
# Username: admin
# Password: admin123 (change immediately!)
```

### Upgrading to 1.5.0

SQL Chat requires an encryption key:

```bash

python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"

# Add to .env
SQL_CHAT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-key
```
